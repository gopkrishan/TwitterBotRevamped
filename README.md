# TwitterBotRevamped
Takes current user listening data and creates and tweets out the song, artist, and song link.   

## Required Libraries
- Spotipy
- Python-Twitter

## Upcoming Features
- (REVERTED) Instead of just having the artists' name, use their twitter handle so they have a direct link.
- Create a database of songs listened to so we can have like a weekly top hits playlist created and tweeted out.

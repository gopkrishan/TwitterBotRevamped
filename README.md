# TwitterBotRevamped
Takes current user listening data and creates and tweets out the song, artist, and song link.   

# Required Libraries
- Spotipy
- Python-Twitter

# Upcoming Features
- (ADDED... sort of. See Changelog - 1/4)Instead of just having the artists' name, use their twitter handle so they have a direct link.
- Create a database of songs listened to so we can have like a weekly top hits playlist created and tweeted out.

# Changelog
